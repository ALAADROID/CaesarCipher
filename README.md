# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption in C
This project implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features
✅ Encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

✅ Decrypts text by reversing the encryption process.

✅ Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.

✅ Ignores non-alphabetic characters (they remain unchanged).

✅ Written in pure C for efficiency and simplicity.


## How It Works
The user enters the text to be encrypted.

The user provides a shift key (an integer).

The program applies the shift to encrypt the text.

The program then decrypts the text back to its original form.
